# Project: Tic Tac Toe iOS App

# This project is an iOS app featuring a standard implementation of Tic Tac Toe. This particular app is a 2 player game. Each of the players must first enter their name when prompted to on the first screen and press 'START THE GAME ->'. The second screen will then pop up with the game. One of the players must press the button at the top of the screen to see which of the two players will make the first move. After that, the players must take turns marking either an 'X' or 'O' on the board (player 1 is 'X' and player 2 is 'O'). The score of the player who wins will be increased by one, and the game can be restarted. The players can play any number of times to reach any particular target score. The project can be opened and tested using Xcode on a Mac.

# This project was written using Swift.
